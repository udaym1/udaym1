Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

You know, I was God once. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Why did you bring us here? Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. That's not soon enough! Shinier than yours, meatbag. Why would a robot need to drink?

I had more, but you go ahead. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

Kif might! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Bender, you risked your life to save me! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
